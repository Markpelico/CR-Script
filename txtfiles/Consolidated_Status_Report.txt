CR A__II - Artemis II Exploration/Orion
Bob - 
    CR A__II
    *         Orion
    o	New IMACS XTCE files
    ?	Retrieved BLD2.0 V7 of the IMACS MRTU xmls, and BLD15.2 V7 and V8 of the 
    IMACS Cmd and Telem xmls.  All out of Ops History on the MSE.
    o	PCAP Files to MSFC
    ?	Shared the 2409-03 ICPS and SLS files for the 8/19 Joint Ascent Sim.
    
    Accomplishments
    *        Completed the SATERN Cybersecurity Training that was due, but also required for an xEVAS 
    NAMS request.
     
    Help Needed
    *        Working on a backup plan for getting files from the kedalion lab.
     
    FYI
    *	Grace told me there’s a problem with traj set 2409-05.  The SLS time is behind ICPS by an 
    hour.  Luis Betancourt determined the SLS time was based on Middle of Window (MOW) instead 
    of Close of Window (COW).  Grace will let ULA know so they can rerun the sim.

CR 88015 - MTC HLS Stub Sim Upgrades for Artemis III Standalone Training Support  - Part1
Sergio - 
    CR 88015 MTC HLS Stub Sim Upgrades for Artemis III Standalone Training Support  - Part1
    *	Duncan and I test Lindy’s HLS Procedure. 
    *	Trying to compile HLS Stub and test with Lindy’s Procedure.
    *	Looked  at Dragon Stub MDT display to get an idea for HLS Stub pages.
Thomas - 
    CR 88015 HLS
    HLS Stub (CR 88015 MTC HLS Stub Sim Upgrades for Artemis III Standalone Training Support) � looking 
    into verifying docking/undocking capability. Ida and dynIda terms don�t match with HLA terms like they 
    should, trying to get that working. Was able to add and compile with ICD file. Seems that originally we 
    had just gotten the dynIda part in order to have a bare-bones docking capability, but low fidelity, looking 
    now to get it more capable.
Duncan - 
    CR 88015 HLS Stub
    Attended meeting and received tasks.
    Analyzing current capabilities of HLS sim.
    This ties into testing procedure Lindy sent out.
