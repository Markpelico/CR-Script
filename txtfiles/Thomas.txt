CR 88015 HLS
HLS Stub (CR 88015 MTC HLS Stub Sim Upgrades for Artemis III Standalone Training Support) � looking 
into verifying docking/undocking capability. Ida and dynIda terms don�t match with HLA terms like they 
should, trying to get that working. Was able to add and compile with ICD file. Seems that originally we 
had just gotten the dynIda part in order to have a bare-bones docking capability, but low fidelity, looking 
now to get it more capable. 

CR A_III HLS-Orion Joint Test 5 � updated test procedure documents for nominal & off-nominal docking and 
undocking
